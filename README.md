# Deep Learning School Part 1: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition.

This repository shows my path to getting better in Computer Vision. Huge thanks
to [Deep Learning School](https://en.dlschool.org/) organised with the help of
[Phystech School of Applied Mathematics and Informatics](https://mipt.ru/english/edu/phystechschools/psami) (Факультет Прикладной Математики и Информатики МФТИ).

**Disclaimer.** The course, in my opinion, is very similar to the [CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition](http://cs231n.stanford.edu/) course from [Stanford](https://www.stanford.edu). Hence, the title and the description.
